# basic-c2
A very basic c2 structure, utilizing a reverse shell connection to execute commands remotely on a client system.

There are still some bugs and fixes to be implemented, however they will likely not be implemented in this repository.

These programs were created as an exercise, and should not be used maliciously against any entity. 
I developed these programs for educational purposes only.
